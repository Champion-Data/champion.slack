# Champion.Slack
A lightweight library for sending messages to Slack via System.Net.Http.HttpClient using System.Text.Json

This is an ongoing side project that only gets a few hours a week. The goal is to release a NuGet package with documentation.

The README will be updated as progress is made.

## TODO / ROADMAP

* Get basic version going
* Ensure XML documentation
* Add example usage to README.md
* Build a fluent interface
* Update documentation
* Get a Github Actions pipeline going to build and publish as a NuGet package
